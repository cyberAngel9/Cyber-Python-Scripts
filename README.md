# Cyber-Python-Scripts

This repository contains five Python scripts that I have worked on and enhanced in various areas. These scripts originate from TCM Python 101 and cover the following topics: SSH Brute Force, Password Cracking, Web Brute Force, SQL Injection, and Restricted SQL Injection. All scripts will be available, and I will provide examples to demonstrate their functionality. 

### SSH-BruteForce.py
The SSH Brute Force script successfully executed a brute force attack on the password, utilizing a provided username and a password list.

### PasswordCracking.py
This script is designed to crack password hashes using the SHA256 algorithm. Upon completing the task, it will display the cracked passwords, provided there is a password file within the script and in the same directory.
